branch	: tree-access, feature branch
purpose : changing the access model for trees and removing heavy usage of update()

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- trees now have getters (getString(), getFunction(), getLatex(), getNodes(), getTerminii()) that
	  return the current evaluation for the respective attribute.  This gets around the issue of keeping
	  an instance attribute that has a copy, because those may be out of sync.  Whenever a method needs 
	  an attribute, it just has to call the appropriate getter.  This also should reduce some of the 
	  computational overhead.
