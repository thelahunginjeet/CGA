branch	: feature-sqlitedb
purpose : adding a sqlite database back-end to record functions and other metadata

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- frequency of writing to database (every n generations) can now be controlled
	- CGAGenerator.generate() function can now produce BinaryNode-biased trees; this has been achieved
		by passing an additional optional parameter (r) to ._getRandomFunctionalNode(), representing 
		the probability of returning a BinaryNode (UnaryNode returned with probability 1-r).  This
		parameter (r) is also logged to the cgaruns database.
