README file for CGA project.

TODO:
	-random numbers in [0,1] as node; variable (random) at creation but fixed afterwards
	-generate more realistic dummy P_ij (symmetric, rows/cols sum to one) and P_i,P_j (cols sum to one, one col repeated 20X) 
	-handling zero elements in P_ij, P_i, P_j (double nansum? pre-screening to remove NaNs?)
	-P_ij,P_i,P_j as numpy arrays or matrices? (currently loaded as matrices)
