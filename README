README file for CGA project.

branch	: feature-sqlitedb
purpose : adding a sqlite database back-end to record functions and other metadata


FEATURES / FIXES:
	- redesign of tables and database logging; see CGALogging
	- 'None' is not written to the DB; instead we use a numeric code for non-numeric
		fitness values:
			NaN : -111
			inf : -11
			-inf : -1
		These are all meaningless fitness values and should not be encountered in a normal, evaluateable 
		tree.
	- probably need a bit more deconstruction of file names; the run db has : in the name, which are a 
		bit of a pain
