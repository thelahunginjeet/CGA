branch	: feature-sqlitedb
purpose : adding a sqlite database back-end to record functions and other metadata

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- added a simple sqlite database to record unique functions, generations, etc. 
	- added a second table to the sqlite database that records metadata about the simulation;
		it is also written in .update()
	- simulation constructor gets selection method and treetype information now as well
	- added exception handling (in case all trees have nan/inf fitness) to sqlite logging; if all
		trees have nan or inf, those statistics are recorded as 0.0 (impossible values - real 
		fitness values are greater than 1.0 by construction)
	- notify() is now called at the beginnning of advance(); this allows us to record the 
		initial population, before the first generation of parental selection/mating
