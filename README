README file for CGA project.

branch	: master
purpose : everything that works goes here

TODO:
	-mutation operators : per-node, or global?  or a mix? 
	-what about nans during selection?  treat as zero?
	-simulation has a lot of parameters; better way to handle them?
	-need random [0,1] numbers in there somehow
	-redundant calls to tree.update() in the mutation operators?
	-remove deprecated mutation operators
	-replace inefficient call to _fillWithRandomData() with a targeted replace of EmptyNode to DataNode
