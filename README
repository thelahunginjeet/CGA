README file for CGA project.

branch	: master
purpose : everything that works goes here

RECENT:
	-added a development branch based on the git model so we can stay off master
	-removed self.cgag from CGASimulation because it is a utility class with static methods
	-	you don't need to initialize it

TODO:
	-need random [0,1] numbers in there somehow
	-remove deprecated mutation operators
	-replace inefficient call to _fillWithRandomData() with a targeted replace of EmptyNode to DataNode
	-would clean things up to make population a class (CGAPopulation); that would allow implementation
		of methods to collect data (max fitness, mean, etc.)

PROBLEMS:
	-function dicts need to initialize new Data/Function objects instead of referencing them 

QUESTIONS:
	-should we formally replace nan/inf/-inf with zero before an advance step?
	-simulation has a lot of parameters; better way to handle them?
	-are there redundant calls to tree.update() in the mutation operators?
	-all mutation operators except crossover are per-node; do we want crossover to be per-node?
	-discovered a "feature" (bug).  Since parents are selected two at a time, producing two offspring, 
		odd forestSizes quickly become even (+1).  Changed things so that forestSize is forced to be
		even (1 is added if forestSize is odd and a message is printed).
