README file for CGA project.

TODO:
	-random numbers in [0,1] as node; variable (random) at creation but fixed afterwards
	-generate more realistic dummy P_ij (symmetric, rows/cols sum to one) and P_i,P_j (cols sum to one, one col repeated 20X) 
	-do we need a nan-compatible trace (nansum(diag(M)), rather than M.trace())?
