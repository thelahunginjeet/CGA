README file for CGA project.

branch	: develop
purpose : further refinement of now functional CGA project code

ADD AND COMMENT BELOW, BUT DO NOT DELETE

TODO:
	- fix LaTeX; extra '\' are being produced, perhaps during database insertion (KB,4/19/11)
	- check fitness definition; we currently getting values that are both too large (> 2) and
	too small (< 0, not including nan/inf/-inf). Perhaps we should just go to a direct fit of
	the pairwise distance matrix, or similar biased towards doing better on the close residues? 
	(KB,4/19/11)
	- add ephemeral random numbers to the Data classes; this allows us to dump a lot of stuff
	that doesn't need to be there ('special' constants like 1/2, 1.0, etc.) (KB,4/19/11)
	- allow scalarizers (or at least sum) within trees, as well as at the root (KB,4/19/11)
	

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- redesign of tables and database logging; see CGALogging
	- 'None' is not written to the DB; instead we use a numeric code for non-numeric
		fitness values:
			NaN : -111
			inf : -11
			-inf : -1
		These are all meaningless fitness values and should not be encountered in a normal, evaluateable 
		tree.
	- probably need a bit more deconstruction of file names; the run db has : in the name, which are a 
		bit of a pain
