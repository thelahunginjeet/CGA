branch	: tree-access, feature branch
purpose : changing the access model for trees

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- I'm worried the get() funcs are a bit wonky; I basically decided every property is subservient 
	to the nodes, since all of them (function, string, etc.) require fetching info from the constituent
	nodes.  Thus a "new call" (when AlgorithmTree._areNodesCurrent = False) always first results in 
	a node eval.  Otherwise, if you call getString() after registering an update, 
	- Is there a danger in copying the update status from a tree?  Is a copy of an up-to-date tree
	actually up to date?
