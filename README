README file for CGA project.

branch	: master
purpose : everything that works goes here

TODO:
	-mutation operators : per-node, or global?  or a mix? 
	-what about nans during selection?  treat as zero?
	-simulation has a lot of parameters; better way to handle them?
	-look at calls in CGAGenerator for mutation operators; usually we will want to mutate a *given* node,
		not a random one (node selection will occur outside the mutation operator)
