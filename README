README file for CGA project.

branch	: develop
purpose : main moving target for the project

FEATURES / FIXES:
	- need to add a copy method for nodes and for subtrees that will retain the structure
		and fix the reference issues
	- need to fix the tree structure; it shouldn't have to update so frequently
		- perhaps it should have getters that update specific features with booleans as indicators
		- e.g. getLeaves() returns a list of terminal nodes self.leaves in (True, False)
